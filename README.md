To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies: npm install
4. Start the development server: npm start
5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

## Login Credentials
To login as a Viewer, use the following credentials:

Username: catalina.herman
Password: Password@123

To login as an Editor, use the following credentials:
